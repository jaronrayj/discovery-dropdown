# discovery-dropdown

Simple discovery page setup!
Link to view - https://jaronrayj.github.io/discovery-dropdown/ 

There is a section in the [index.html](https://github.com/jaronrayj/discovery-dropdown/blob/master/index.html) that you will need to edit to your specific domain and authentication type.

Also, you can set up your own logo by replacing "replaceMeWithUrl" with your logo url. 

Within the Script tags near the top of the page - 

`var studentTeacherUrl = "https://DOMAIN.instructure.com/login/saml"`
* Replace DOMAIN with your Canvas url domain
* Replace saml with whatever authentication you want to utilize. You can ask your Customer Success Manager if you are uncertain.

`var parentUrl = "https://DOMAIN.instructure.com/login/canvas"`
* Replace DOMAIN with your Canvas url domain

`var imgPlaceholder = "replaceMeWithUrl"`
* Replace replaceMeWithUrl with your logo url
